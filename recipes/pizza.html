<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Pizza dough:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
</li>
<li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>

<li>1 pinch white sugar</li>

<li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>

<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>

<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
</ul>

<h4>Garlic oil:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pizza toppings:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
    <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.

</li>
    <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.

</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.

</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
    <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.

</li>
    <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.

</li>
    <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.

</li>
    <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.

</li>
    <li>Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.
